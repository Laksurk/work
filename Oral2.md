As learners, you can actively take part in the learning process and to reflect on what you have learnt. This is called "active learning". Here are some tips on it. 

First, you should listen to the outer voice. Your inner voice expresses your personal opinions, while the outer voice tells you about opinions from what you hear or read. Sometimes the inner voice can get in the way of learning. Active learners are open-minded and focus on what the speaker / writer is saying. 

When your inner voice tells you he is wrong, you can argue with it by thinking about why he may be right. Be flexible in your opinions and you might end up agreeing with him after all. 

Second, asking questions is the easiest way to promote active learning. The answers to the questions will lead you to achieve a higher level of understanding about the topic. 

Third, you should attempt to find the truth at the heart of each ideas. Trying to find out the source of an idea will increase your chance of learning something. 

Last, you need to focus on the message. Some people miss out on learning opportunities because they let their feelings get in the way. Active learners do not judge people based on first impressions or personal feelings.

Dr. Smith gives us some effective ways to learn English. 

First, we should increase our knowledge of English beyond the classroom by reading more. We can try simplified classic literature, such as short stories and novels rewritten in simple English. We can also listen to English programmes to get sufficient language input. 

Second, it's important to use effective strategies of memorising words. We can learn new words in context. For example, when reading English stories, we can keep reading on even when we come across some new words. A lot of the time, we'll be able to guess the meaning of an unfamiliar word without looking it up. we can also learn words in chunks. 

Last, when we learn a grammar rule, just memorising the rule is not helpful. We should try to use it in speaking and writing activities, so finally we can use the rules without thinking. 

After listening to these tips, we can have better ideas about how to learn English effectively now.

Students have different feelings on teachers' feedback. 

There are some types of feedback that students dislike. Some teachers point out students' mistakes or problems in front of the whole class, and most of the feedback is negative. However, direct negative comments can make students feel quite hurt. They might lose confidence in themselves. Other teachers often make very general comments and doesn't point out students' mistakes and give suggestions. Students want more specific feedback. 

On the other hand, there is feedback that students like. Some teachers talk to their students face to face. Although it's very demanding for them, it is more effective than other types of feedback. Students like  teachers who highlight their problems in a less direct manner. This will encourage them and tell them how to improve at the same time.

As an Olympic triathlete, I live my life to extremes to get to the top. 

My friend is worried that I have no longer become fun train with and that I'm in danger of being left with only a world championship medal and no one to share it with. I'm always tired and every workout has a mental intensity that seems too mush for most to handle. Sometimes I doubt whether the sacrifices and effort are worth. 

However, I have good reasons for pushing myself to the limits. It boils down to this: I was born with an enormous amount of drive and determination. I have always live my life to extremes. If your dream is to be the best and reach the winner's platform, you'd better be totally committed to your sport. I'd prefer to get ahead instead of being an average person. 

In order to get to the top, I make great efforts. I give up everything for the sport, making full preparations that will set me apart from my competitors. I'm totally committed to my sport, and it's all about that little extra bit I need to do to strive for greatness.
