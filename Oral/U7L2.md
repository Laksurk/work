Beijing Opera is a form of Chinese opera which started in the late eighteenth century. It combines acting, talking, singing, music, dancing and acrobatics together, all of which are skills difficult to master. Simple movements in Beijing Opera often represent more complex actions. For example, If the main character walks across the stage with a flag on each side of her, that means she's riding in a carriage. 

There are four roles Beijing Opera performers can play: *sheng* are common male roles; *dan* are female roles; *jing* are male roles with brightly painted masks; *chou* are clown roles. Each roles has its own singing and acting styles. 

In the past, Beijing Opera was usually performed on open-air stages that were lit only by oil lamps. In order to be heard over the crowds, the music had to be loud and performers had to sing in very high voices. That's why Beijing Opera has a very unique sound. Besides, Beijing Opera has beautiful costumes in bright colours. Because of the dim light, the costumes had to have bright and colourful patterns to attract the audience's attention. 

Beijing Opera is enjoyed by people all over the world, and it's definitely one of China's national treasures.
