Martin Luther King is a great man who fought to win equal rights for black people in the US. 

When King was a boy, he suffered racial discrimination. In 1943, when he took the bus with his black teacher, the white driver told them to give their seats to two white people. Although King didn't want to give up his seat, he was forced to do so. It was definitely a shame for him. 

In 1955, King organised a bus protest, and asked all black people to stop taking buses. After some struggles, they won the right to sit next to white people on buses. This was King's first victory.

In the 1960s, King organised many peaceful protests, but he was put behind bars many times for doing so. In 1963, he organised a march to Washington D. C. and made a famous and inspiring speech with the words "I have a dream". 

One year later, King received the Nobel Peace Prize. But, unfortunately, he was killed a few years later in 1968. It was a great loss. King has inspired people around the world to fight for equal rights and justice.

Beijing Opera is a form of Chinese opera which started in the late eighteenth century. It combines acting, talking, singing, music, dancing and acrobatics together, all of which are skills difficult to master. Simple movements in Beijing Opera often represent more complex actions. For example, If the main character walks across the stage with a flag on each side of her, that means she's riding in a carriage. 

There are four roles Beijing Opera performers can play: *sheng* are common male roles; *dan* are female roles; *jing* are male roles with brightly painted masks; *chou* are clown roles. Each role has its own singing and acting styles. 

In the past, Beijing Opera was usually performed on open-air stages that were lit only by oil lamps. In order to be heard over the crowds, the music had to be loud and performers had to sing in very high voices. That's why Beijing Opera has a very unique sound. Besides, Beijing Opera has beautiful costumes in bright colours. Because of the dim light, the costumes had to have bright and colourful patterns to attract the audience's attention. 

Beijing Opera is enjoyed by people all over the world, and it's definitely one of China's national treasures.

Ludwig van Beethoven was a German composer who is regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of music. He had been very famous for his skills on the piano in his twenties, but then he began to lose his hearing. He thought about giving up, but in the end he continued to write music. Inspired by his struggles with deafness, Beethoven produced some amazing music pieces, including nine symphonies, five piano pieces, and an opera. 

Beethoven spend several years composing his Symphony No. 9. In 1824, the final notes were added to the score. As he proudly sighed his name at the bottom of the page, Beethoven tried to imagine how people would respond when they heard it for the first time. 

Before the performance, the backstage atmosphere was tense. Beethoven was afraid that the performance would be a disaster. When the performance began, he took charge of the orchestra together with the theatre's musical director, Michael Umlauf. Beethoven jumped about in front of the orchestra, waving his arms wildly in the air, and madly turning the pages of his score, while Umlauf stood quietly by his side, skilfully guiding the orchestra through the amazing piece of music. 

The performance turned out to be a success, which proved that Beethoven is definitely a musical genius in the history.

Most people suffer from "Just-me-ism", which causes too much waste of resources. They leave the tap running when brushing their teeth, leave a light on when going out, and drop a piece of litter and can't be bothered to pick it up. Millions of people think "it doesn't matter because it's just me", which leads to huge waste. To inspire young people to take action for the environment, animals and their community, *Roots & Shoots* was established. 

*Roots & Shoots* is an organization set up in the early 1990s by Dr. Jane Goodall, a scientist who's the world's best-known expert on wild chimpanzees. In addition to her research, she has been whole-heartedly committed to environmental protection. The aim of *Roots & Shoots* is to educate young people so they can help to build a future that is secure and live together in peace with nature. The organization is called *Roots & Shoots* because roots move slowly under the ground to make a firm foundation, and shoots seem small and weak, but they can break open brick walls to reach the light. 

The main belief of *Roots & Shoots* is that every individual matters, and every individual has a role to play in making the world a better place. If people want to be a part of a community for a shared future, they cannot be absent.

Cycling is popular in Amsterdam. The city is flat and therefore convenient for bikes. There are also plenty of places for bicycle parking and most streets have a bicycle path. That's why "white bikes" originated in Amsterdam. 

In 1960s, a group of cycling fans came up with an idea. They believed that it would better for everybody if cars weren't allowed in the city centre and only bicycles were. They painted hundreds of bicycles white and placed them in many areas around Amsterdam for people to use. 

However, problems came and the "white bikes" all disappeared â€” thieves stole them in a matter of weeks. The return of "white bikes" was in 1999, with a computer tracking system to record the bikes' every move. This time the bikes were painted in different bright colours. People needed to put in a special card before using them and placed them at a special parking place near their destination. 

Nowadays, shared bikes are popular in China. People consider bike-sharing as a cheap and easy way to save energy, reduce air and noise pollution, and enjoy the benefits of exercise in cities. However, problems can also develop, like the theft of bikes and parking issues. Fortunately, people are trying different ways of solving them. Everyone can decide the future of shared bikes.
